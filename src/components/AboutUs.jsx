                Pravira's the elegance was born out of a mother's curiosity to
                instill the concept of Independence in her child. Let me
                elaborate, 2 choices were in front of me. One my career & the
                other my daughter. I chose my princess. But I didn't realize
                that my daughter was observing me each day. One day she comes to
                me and says Amma, I want to be like you. What a happy day for a
                mother but the next few words shook me hard. She added that she
                wanted to do all the house chores & stay at home.

                Just like me. Not wrong at all, BUT being my daughter's hope I
                wanted her to see my entrepreneur skills too. That's how my
                venture was born. A world filled with handcrafted jewellery's.
                That's done with same love and care that a mother shows to her
                child. Converting my passion into profession is the first step
                towards our journey. Pravira's is home of jewellery's our
                design, your designs anything u say can be done. So do visit us.
                And support a mother's passion ðŸ˜Š
